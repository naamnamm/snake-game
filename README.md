## Summary
The most chalenging part of creating this game was figuring out how to turn the snake up-down-left-right. When I worked through it, it helps me realize how important brainstorming and pseudo coding the process is.

I learn to do things better such as not to hard-coded the positions and to limit the scope variable in order to reduce bugs. This makes my code nicer and cleaner.

This also give me oppotunity to deepen my knowledge in the fundamentals such as scope variables and object oriented programing and learn new things such as working with canvas element.

It's fun indeed to create something really awesome and learn something new!
